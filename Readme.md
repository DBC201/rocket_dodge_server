# Rocket Dodge
- To run without https do ```node rocket_dodge_main.js -n or --no_https```
- To run without redis do ```node rocket_dodge_main.js -r or --no_redis```

You will still need a database and .env variables for the website to function properly.
Database schema and .env variables can be found in the root directory. .env.local must be
created, .env is just there to serve as a template.
